Sociable, enthusiastic and a doer, I look for challenges at every corner. I love travelling, am a huge foodie and love being outdoors. It is my belief that travelling and acquiring international experience has an immense impact on an individual's ability of integrating in a changing and dynamic environment, creating confident social networks and becoming open-minded towards future projects. In addition, travelling nurtures my interest for cross-cultural experiences, which impact on habits, behaviour, beliefs and values.",
